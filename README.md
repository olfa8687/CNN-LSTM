# CNN-LSTM-Based Intrusion Detection Model (using CICIDS2018)

This repository contains the source code for a CNN-LSTM neural network implemented in Python using Keras. The model is designed for network intrusion detection using the CICIDS2018 dataset, and it replicates the experiments conducted in our research.
